An Echo in the Space
-- // -----------------------------------------------------------------

- There exists one god that is everywhere and part of all: the universe; the universe won't come, nor stand to save anyone.
- The circumstances of their death will influence the value of their life.
- One cannot posibly enjoy anything they don't have full knowledge of.
- Three. Three? Weren't there four of them?
- Paradize and hell are not places they go, but space to fill in the memories of those who will outlive them.
- A suicide a day keeps the pressure away!
- Alone in the darkness, it shines...
- Snakes appear strait under a bent ruler...
- When the conquerors come in, the mountain perspires by the tiger's ass, and the dragon fucks the weasel.
- The fact we have the luxury to to complain about inanities is an indicator that we feel safe enough otherwise to do so.
- Could they have alleviated the part of the report about undergone physical sufferings?
- It likes to see their hope vanish...
- Life is not beautiful by nature, it becomes what they make of it.
- Life doesn't diverge from the existence of death, but rather death arises from the concept of life.
- Those who try to mine gold out of it, they shall receive nothing but dirt.
- It was ridiculous, it seems dangerous, it might become obvious...
- By the time of their disgrace, it shall awake...
- In its long agony, its knowledge is lost.
- It bites those who try to break its chains.
- They will be gnawed by what they demanded; they shall simply receive what they earned.
- When asked what it wanted to do once grown up, it answered that it wanted to do...
- They deplorably still can't accept the idea of infinity, clinging to the idea that all thing begins and ends...

Level System
-- // -----------------------------------------------------------------

const level = new Promise(resolve => {
	const universe = initialize( new Universe() )
	// ...
	.add(class ... extends Trait {
		onUpdate() {
			if (playerIsDown) resolve(DEFEAT)
			else if (count(enemies) == 0) resolve(VICTORY)
		}
	})
	// ...
	universe.run()
})
// There you go: a level system.
// Now, how do we implement level "stages"... several ".then-chained" promises?
